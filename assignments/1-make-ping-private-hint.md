To access properties in javascript, you can use `foo.bar` and `foo['bar']` interchangably.  Prefer the first syntax, but be aware you can use both.  
 
The `userstate` variable inside of client.on represents the user who sent the most recent message.  

Consider that `userstate.turbo` would let you know if that user has `turbo` or not... whatever that is.
